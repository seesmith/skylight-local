            <p>The Stuart period, from the reign of King James V of Scotland (1513–42) to that of Queen Anne of Great
                Britain (1702–14), was a time of religious and political turmoil.  As well as civil war and revolution,
                however, there were also periods of stability, the uniting of the crowns of Scotland and England and a
                flourishing court culture. Music was important in courtly life and was enjoyed in many settings, from
                private performances to extravagant events.</p>

            <p>Musical instruments are important tools in helping us understand the soundscapes of the past. By studying
                them, we can explore how music from earlier times could have sounded. What an instrument looks like is
                also important since the materials chosen and the amount of decoration can tell us about the wealth and
                status of the owner. Examples from the University of Edinburgh’s collections show the types of instrument
                which were popular during the Stuart period, many of which are recognisable as early versions of the
                instruments we play today. </p>
