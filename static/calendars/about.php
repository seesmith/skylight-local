        <h1>About the University of Edinburgh Calendar Collection</h1>
        <p>Calendars are produced every year to showcase the diverse range of material held in the University's collections. These are generally produced around a specific theme, e.g. Bygone Edinburgh (2014), Historic Musical Instruments (2012) and Travel (2008)  but in some years (e.g. 2010 and 2011) a selection of images illustrating Treasures of the Collections are selected.</p>
        <p>All images were created by the Digital Imaging Unit and are copyright the University of Edinburgh.<p/>
        <p>Images from all calendars, from 2006 onwards will be available in this collection.<p/>
