      <h1>How to participate</h1>
      <p>
          Everyone remembers the Library – the conversations in the café, the rush for books as exams and essay deadlines
          loomed, the moment of discovery when you found a resource that answered your questions. The Library is and always
          will be the beating heart of the University.
      </p>
      <p> Last year the Library received a record two million visits. Whilst this is wonderful, it also takes a toll on
          our resources. Students and alumni come not only to use the books but to view online journals, e-books, museum
          objects and works of art. With over 35km of Special Collections and increased interest in them, they need extra
          support to help cope with this growing and changing demand.
      </p>
        <h3>Volunteer with us</h3>
        <p>There are a range of ways to get involved with our collections, and we have a number of volunteer opportunities
