        <p>
            For the first time, the scale and variety of the collections held at the University of Edinburgh have been
            captured in a single, fully illustrated volume. The Directory of Collections at the University of Edinburgh
            presents a detailed and easily navigable guide to the main named heritage collections of the University,
            introduced by a section on its most iconic items.<p>
            <p>

            The University holds one of the world's greatest collections, which has been growing since its foundation in
            1582. It includes rare books, archives and manuscripts, art, historical musical instruments and a wide range
            of other museum objects from geological specimens to anatomical models - in total, some 60 kilometres of
            heritage material. They are curated by specialist staff across 45 different sites within the University and
            are used for teaching, research and by the wider public community.
