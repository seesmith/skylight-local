            The University of Edinburgh enjoys a long-standing
            and productive relationship with India and an
            exhibition in the Library opening during the Fringe Festival
            this year, the 70th anniversary of Indian Independence,
            provides an excellent opportunity to showcase and
            celebrate the University’s historic collections relating
            to the sub-continent.

            These objects – books, manuscripts, sculptures and
            paintings – collected over a period of 300 years, span
            two millennia of art and culture and are rich both in
            variety and depth. Most of the objects have never been
            exhibited in public before; this will be the first ever
            public exhibition of University Collections devoted
            to the art and culture of South Asia.
