        <p>Since 2012, the Wellcome Trust has funded a number of projects relating to animal genetics collections held
            at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Research Collections. ‘Towards Dolly: Edinburgh, Roslin and the
            Birth of Modern Genetics’ and ‘The Making of Dolly: Science, Politics and Ethics’ have catalogued, preserved
            and made available archival, printed and visual collections relating to animal genetics in Edinburgh, from
            nineteenth century zoology to the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996, and beyond to present day cutting-edge
            research. Working on the project were Rare Book Cataloguer Kristy Davis and Project Archivist Clare Button.
        </p>
        <p>In all, 23 collections have been catalogued and preserved, with key items receiving conservation treatment.
            These collections include rare books, scientific papers, the archives of institutions such as Roslin
            Institute and the papers of pioneering scientists including Charlotte Auerbach, C.H. Waddington and Sir
            Ian Wilmut. Nine oral history recordings were also carried out with leading contemporary geneticists.
        </p>
        <p>Between October 2014 and May 2015, the project ‘Science on a Plate: the natural sciences through glass slides,
            1870-1930’ digitised nearly 3,500 historic glass slides which were catalogued as part of ‘Towards Dolly’.
            Depicting different animal breeds and scenes and people from around the world, this rich visual resource
            is now available to  <a href="http://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/UoEgal~6~6" title="Roslin Glass Slide online" target="_blank">view online</a>.
        </p>

        <p>These projects were generously funded by the Wellcome Trust's

        <p>From July to October 2015, the University of Edinburgh Main Library Exhibition Gallery hosted the
            <a href="https://exhibitions.ed.ac.uk/towardsdolly" title="Toward's Dolly Exhibition online" target="_blank">exhibition</a>
            ‘Towards Dolly: a century of animal genetics in Edinburgh.’ This was curated by Project Archivist Clare Button
            and featured an array of archival, printed and visual collections, as well as Dolly the sheep herself, on
            loan courtesy of National Museums Scotland. Watch the Library and University Collections Digital Imaging
