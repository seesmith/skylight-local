        <p> Modern archival case records are rich resources for medical humanities’ researchers, clinicians and genealogists
            alike, giving context to ground-breaking procedures and telling fascinating stories about the development of
            medical care in the twentieth century. Case notes are collected documents produced during the treatment and
            care of a particular patient. Loose notes in folders superseded the use of bound books from the mid-1920s,
            and they record the progress of patients in a range of ways, from typed summaries to a range of charts,
            handwritten notes, x-rays, photographs, drawings and letters.</p>

        <p>Despite case notes’ potential as an academic resource, their research use to date has been limited. Researchers
            can be deterred by case notes’ physical condition (often housed in original folders), the sheer number of
            records produced, time-consuming searches for a particular category of data and case notes’ extremely specialist
            medical language. Confidentiality restrictions on modern health records also mean that potential researchers
            have to meet strict conditions for access even for scoping purposes. Previous grants from the Wellcome Trust
            have rehoused many of our most significant collections of
            <a href="http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/conservation/conserv_case_notes.htm" title="Case Notes" target="_blank"> case notes</a>, r
            emoving physical barriers to their access. LHSA’s case note cataloguing aims to remove more intellectual hurdles,
            realising the potential of these absorbing records as research resources.</p>

        <p> Funded by the Wellcome Trust, LHSA began a
            <a href="http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/projects/Cataloguingcasenotes.htm" title="Cataloguing Case Notes" target="_blank">project to catalogue</a>
            over 26,500 cases created by renowned Edinburgh neurosurgeon, Norman Dott in 2012.
            Cataloguing Norman Dott’s neurosurgical case notes (1920 – 1960) developed a methodology that describes each
            case in language accessible to researchers from different backgrounds whilst protecting patient privacy. Using
            the Encoded Archival Description (EAD)eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) standard along with tailored index terms
            allows confidential data to be hidden from a public, online catalogue whilst emphasising other, non-identifying
            details for search. Dott’s case notes span his formidable career, from early private practice in the 1920s to
            opening the first neurosurgery department in Scotland in 1938, his wartime service to military patients and his
            flagship achievement in 1960: the Department of Surgical Neurology at the Western General Hospital, a pioneering
            centre of neurosurgical treatment and rehabilitation.</p>

        <p>When LHSA was awarded a further Wellcome Trust Research Resources grant in 2013, the same methodology was used
            to describe cases from a very different specialism. RVH v TB: a project to catalogue LHSA’s Royal Victoria Hospital
            Tuberculosis and Diseases of the Chest Case Notes and Registers will catalogue over 24,000 individual cases
            treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital, in its dispensary and sanatoriums and in the Scottish Mass Miniature
            Radiography (MMR) campaigns of 1957 and 1958. Although the cataloguing methodology remains basically the same
            as that used for Dott’s cases, the nature of tuberculosis means that certain details are emphasised above
            others for search.</p>

        <p>These pages act as a gateway to LHSA case note catalogues produced to date. They will give you an idea of the
            people, places and ideas behind the cases and provide a ‘user-guide’ to searching the collections. At present,
            only the catalogue to Dott’s case notes can be accessed, but new catalogues will be added as they are completed.
